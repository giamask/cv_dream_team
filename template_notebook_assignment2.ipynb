(fill in your student numbers!)\n","\n","In this group assignment your team will delve into some deep learning applications for computer vision. The assignment will be delivered in the same groups from *Group assignment 1* and you start from this template notebook. The notebook you submit for grading is the last notebook pinned as default and submitted to the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/t/d11be6a431b84198bc85f54ae7e2563f) prior to the deadline on **Wednesday 22 May 23:59**. Closely follow [these instructions](https://github.com/gourie/kaggle_inclass) for joining the competition, sharing your notebook with the TAs and making a valid notebook submission to the competition. A notebook submission not only produces a *submission.csv* file that is used to calculate your competition score, it also runs the entire notebook and saves its output as if it were a report. This way it becomes an all-in-one-place document for the TAs to review. As such, please make sure that your final submission notebook is self-contained and fully documented (e.g. provide strong arguments for the design choices that you make). Most likely, this notebook format is not appropriate to run all your experiments at submission time (e.g. the training of CNNs is a memory hungry and time consuming process; due to limited Kaggle resources). It can be a good idea to distribute your code otherwise and only summarize your findings, together with your final predictions, in the submission notebook. For example, you can substitute experiments with some text and figures that you have produced \"offline\" (e.g. learning curves and results on your internal validation set or even the test set for different architectures, pre-processing pipelines, etc). We advise you to first go through the PDF of this assignment entirely before you really start. Then, it can be a good idea to go through this notebook and use it as your first notebook submission to the competition. You can make use of the *Group assignment 2* forum/discussion board on Toledo if you have any questions. Good luck and have fun!\n","\n","---------------------------------------------------------------\n","NOTES:\n","* This notebook is just a template. Please keep the five main sections, but feel free to adjust further in any way you please!\n","* Clearly indicate the improvements that you make! You can for instance use subsections like: *3.1.

In the second part, you will do the same for semantic segmentation. For these two tasks we expect you to put a significant effort into optimizing performance and as such competing with fellow students via the Kaggle competition. In the third part, you will try to find and exploit the weaknesses of your classification and/or segmentation network. For the latter there is no competition format, but we do expect you to put significant effort in achieving good performance on the self-posed goal for that part. Finally, we ask you to reflect and produce an overall discussion with links to the lectures and \"real world\" computer vision (Sect. 5). It is important to note that only a small part of the grade will reflect the actual performance of your networks. However, we do expect all things to work! In general, we will evaluate the correctness of your approach and your understanding of what you have done that you demonstrate in the descriptions and discussions in the final notebook."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.014263,"end_time":"2022-04-12T14:48:23.530341","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-12T14:48:23.516078","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## 1.1 Deep learning resources\n","If you did not yet explore this in *Group assignment 1 (Sect. 2)*, we recommend using the TensorFlow and/or Keras library for building deep learning models.
